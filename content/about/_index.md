System design has always drawn me in. From playing Sim City to observing the ecosystem in the small pond behind my 
grandparent's house, the emerging complexity hidden behind seemingly tidy layers of systems is endlessly interesting. 

I have been incredibly fortunate to make a career of tinkering with the wonderfully complex world of software. I spent the
first six and a half years of my career working at a small web agency where I had the opportunity to work on all sorts
of different systems at every layer of the stack. Most recently, I've been at a small but growing startup helping aquaculture 
grow responsibly and sustainably. It has been really neat to work alongside data scientists and oceanographers every day.

I love how accessible Javascript is and, despite it's quirks, I've really enjoyed building things in it for the better part
of the last decade. Most recently, the functional approach of React has been really exciting to watch evolve. I've gone
plenty far into the Clojure rabbit hole and it blows my mind. Most recently, I've been on a real procedural generation/chaos
theory kick. Simulating things like [Boids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw) is fascinating.

When I'm not playing with code, I am an avid birder. I've been dabbling in [bird photography](https://www.instagram.com/diagnosisbirder/), 
and try to do a healthy amount of traveling in [my campervan](https://www.instagram.com/theohvan/). As a relatively well-travelled
person that has been paying close attention to birds, my primary motivation moving forward is looking for interesting
ways to solve the climate crisis and protect the irreplaceable biodiversity around us. To that end, I've been working on
[Searching for Birds](https://www.searchingforbirds.com) in my spare time to advocate for our avian friends.

Thanks for stopping by.
