I created this site as a creative outlet during my sabbatical. It's evolved into a showcase and exercise of my design, writing, 
photography, and programming skills.

My goal is to both make the birding hobby easier to jump into and highlight how the climate crisis is impacting birds.

Additionally, I have used it as a proof of concept for a very basic content management platform using NextJS and Markdown.
To that end, all posts are saved as plain markdown files that are processed by NextJS `getStaticProps` to build a mostly
static site.

The site is hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com) which automatically triggers new builds whenever I push an update.

Please have a look around! Here are some screenshots:
