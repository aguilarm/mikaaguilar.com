In the process of researching building a voxel engine in ThreeJS/React-Three-Fiber, I found that a key component
of voxel worlds is generating heightmaps to render terrain. So, I built this small project to wrap my head around
that system before I tried adding voxels into the mix.

I had a little fun styling it with a kind of retro space theme and adding some customization controls. Click the demo
button above to try it out!
