Following my small project exploring procedural generation in 2D, [where I built a procedurally generated galaxy map](/projects/procedural-galaxy.md),
I eventually fell down the rabbit hole of minecraft clones.

I am of course very intrigued by the handful of very interesting programming problems presented by minecraft and have set
out to build a clone myself. I found react-three-fiber and built the [three-js hello cube example in it](https://github.com/aguilarm/react-three-fiber-hello-cube) 
so I could get my bearings and wrap my head around the basics.

Since then I've built an MVP 3D game with a player entity that moves with a camera, a few blocks, and physics. I'm very
excited to continue iterating and bring in a procedurally generated world soon.
