      <description>This site is running Hugo with GitHub pages, and I am really happy with the setup. There are a lot of options for spinning up a personal blog site, and I really think building with Hugo is the best option.
Why Hugo Hugo is a static site generator. Everyone is really jumping on the static+serverless or JAMStack hype train these days, and there are many good reasons for that. Here are a few:</description>

      <title>How I Stay Focused with Work Logs</title>

      <description>At any moment, I tend to have quite a few things that need my attention. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I&amp;rsquo;ll need to context switch several times during the day - from answering a question to attending a meeting or checking in on a long-running process.
Jumping in and out of contexts can be pretty difficult and will really cost a lot of time.
In an effort to be as available as possible for the occasional interruption without spending a ton of time getting back into whatever I&amp;rsquo;m working on, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using timestamped work logs.</description>

      <title>Debouncing and Throttling React Events</title>
      <link>https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/react-event-debounce-throttle/</link>

      <description>Throttling and debouncing events in React is something that is often overlooked and can usually save you from a significant amount of UI lag or jankiness. Doing either one is relatively simple but easy to implement incorrectly.
I think it may be useful to learn how these work by slowly evolving approaches until we land on a nice simple one.
What&amp;rsquo;s the Difference? Throttling an event means &amp;lsquo;do this at most once every x milliseconds&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>2019 Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/2019-tech-stack-retrospective/</link>

      <guid>https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/2019-tech-stack-retrospective/</guid>
      <description>This past year my tech stack saw some exciting changes. We fully embraced React Hooks, Typescript and GraphQL. We poked around the JAMStack and built a fairly large NextJS application. That was a real pivot from the primarily Drupal based projects we&amp;rsquo;ve done before. While we&amp;rsquo;re still using Drupal as a headless CMS, we have ditched the entire front-end of it. Server-wise, Kubernetes and Docker have remained a nice constant this year with a year perhaps defined by stability while the tech reached maturity.</description>

      <description>At work, we run a lot of different websites. From time to time, we need to renew the HTTPS certs used by some of the unfortunate few not powered by Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt yet. Recently, I needed a simple way to describe what was happening through the whole process.
When I turned to google looking for a simple explanation, what I found was either a bit too simple or way too deep.</description>

      <title>Tuning Php Fpm</title>
      <link>https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/tuning-php-fpm/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been running php-fpm at a pretty significant scale for quite some time now and have played around with a bunch of different performance configurations in an attempt to do so efficiently. Our stack is varnish &amp;gt; nginx &amp;gt; php-fpm. Php is running Drupal behind all of that, and the vast majority of a site is hitting varnish cache. Occasionally we&amp;rsquo;ll have to warm up caches or something will leak through and we&amp;rsquo;ll have to deal with a sizeable surge of concurrent requests.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put together a list of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so I can direct folks to this post when asked for something to read. Most of the programming books have free online editions, so get to it!
I&amp;rsquo;m also a huge fan of sci-fi, so I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown a couple of my favorites in at the end.
If you&amp;rsquo;re more visual, I&amp;rsquo;ve also made this list of talks I recommend.</description>

      <description>Alright, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it everywhere for the last couple of years - decoupled Drupal. I&amp;rsquo;ve been eyeing the available solutions for some time and finally feel like things are in a good spot to make the jump over. Buckle up and join me on my journey to find a rightful heir to Drupal 8&amp;rsquo;s frontend.

      <title>Easily Patch Contrib Drupal Modules Composer</title>
      <link>https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/easily-patch-contrib-drupal-modules-composer/</link>

      <description>The workflow for patching Drupal modules can be a bit obtuse if you do everything by hand, but with composer it&amp;rsquo;s easy!
I manage all contributed modules with composer, so an example composer.json might look like this:
{ &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;example&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Drupal 8 Example&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;minimum-stability&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;dev&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;prefer-stable&amp;quot;: true, &amp;quot;repositories&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;composer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://packages.drupal.org/8&amp;quot; } ], &amp;quot;require&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;cweagans/composer-patches&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^1.6&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;composer/installers&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^1.6&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^2.5&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drupal/core&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^8.6&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drush/drush&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^9.5&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;drupal/health_check&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^1.</description>

      <title>Talks I Love</title>

      <description>All of these talks have had a large impact on how I approach problems or understand different aspects of the art of programming. If you have the time, I really recommend going through each and every one of these videos.
If you prefer reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered with this post listing my book recommendations.
I&amp;rsquo;ll start off by listing talks that I think are relevant no matter what problem space you&amp;rsquo;re working in, and add some more targeted talks to different sections below.</description>
