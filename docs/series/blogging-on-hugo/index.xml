      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll need some templates to render your new content. Hugo templates exist in the /layouts directory. The docs for the base templates are decent, but I&amp;rsquo;ll give a quick rundown from top to bottom.
Baseof At the very top of your site is the layouts/default/baseof.html. This includes the outer shell of your site starting from the &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; element. Here is a minimal example I pulled from the docs:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  &amp;lt;!</description>

      <description>This guide assumes that you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to read any of the Hugo docs. I&amp;rsquo;m totally ok with that - I&amp;rsquo;ll link you to the parts that I&amp;rsquo;d otherwise repeat. We&amp;rsquo;ll also be sticking with the bare minimum needed to get going with a blog and have a great time. There are plenty of bells and whistles I&amp;rsquo;ll show you in a later section of the guide.
Step 0 - Installing Hugo The very first thing you need to do is install the binary.</description>

      <description>This site is running Hugo with GitHub pages, and I am really happy with the setup. There are a lot of options for spinning up a personal blog site, and I really think building with Hugo is the best option.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to guide you through building a blog with it in this series of posts.
Lets start off with the most important question - why.
The JAMStack ðŸŽ¸ Hugo is a static site generator, which is the Markdown bit of the JAMStack.</description>
