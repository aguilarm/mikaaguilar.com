<p>This past year my tech stack saw some exciting changes. We fully embraced React Hooks, Typescript and GraphQL. We poked around the JAMStack and built a fairly large NextJS application. That was a real pivot from the primarily Drupal based projects we&rsquo;ve done before. While we&rsquo;re still using Drupal as a headless CMS, we have ditched the entire front-end of it. Server-wise, Kubernetes and Docker have remained a nice constant this year with a year perhaps defined by stability while the tech reached maturity.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-i-do>What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>As 2019 dawned on the world, we were starting a new greenfield project. I had the opportunity to jump out of tuning our Kubernetes workloads and try to get a feel for what was going on in the front-end space. The biggest rumblings seemed to be around the &lsquo;JAMStack&rsquo; (Javascript, APIs, and Markup) which promised to allow you to ditch long running server processes. Having spent most of the last two years tweaking such processes, that sounded awesome. Even though I felt I was pretty good at wrangling the little beasts into happily humming along, I was definitely hoping that eventually we could move to something a little simpler to maintain.</p>
<p>My new project, however, was planned to be providing lots of dynamic content that varied heavily depending on what user was viewing it. So, <a href=https://www.mikaaguilar.com/posts/building-decoupled-drupal-sites-2019>while I gave Gatsby a shot</a>, I moved to NextJS to power this project, with a headless Drupal CMS hooked up to it via GraphQL through <a href=https://www.apollographql.com/>Apollo</a>. We added typescript to this project as well. In the process of adding Typescript, I used <a href=https://eslint.org/>ESLint</a> and added <a href=https://github.com/typicode/husky>Husky</a> for pre-commit validation as well as <a href=https://prettier.io/>Prettier</a> to keep code looking the same. I decided to stick with SASS for CSS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been quite nice to work in this stack. Typescript and ESLint with Prettifier have enormously improved our code readability and stability. Using React for all of our front-end is a lot more consistent than the half Drupal php/twig templates with a bit of JS sprinkled around. With React everywhere, we have access to a massive library of open source UI component implementations that speed development. It&rsquo;s also generally more accessible to engineers than twig templates in PHP. GraphQL is nice to consume on the front-end and we&rsquo;ve moved nearly all of the code-based interaction with Drupal behind it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had some paper-cuts using this, and I would be remiss not to point some of those out. Firstly, I&rsquo;ve not been able to tune Apollo client side caching nicely and the methods for managing it feel a bit clunky. Webpack is powering this and it&rsquo;s <em>still</em> a real awkward abstraction with a large amount of configuration holding us together though it has improved a bit as the year progressed. Overall, however, I would say this setup was a net-positive. So what do I hope to do different in 2020?</p>
<h2 id=whats-next>Whats Next?</h2>
<p>There appears to be a new kid on the block, called <a href=https://svelte.dev/>Svelte</a>. I&rsquo;ve done just a bit of poking around with it, and the code you actually write using it is super duper simple. It&rsquo;s wildly efficient computationally as well, double win! I am 100% on the hype train for this one but there is definitely more I need to consider about it. I hope to build something with it this coming year to give it a shot.</p>
<p>It is also starting to feel like we&rsquo;re going to use something besides Drupal as our CMS this year. Things like <a href=https://hasura.io/>Hasura</a> and <a href=https://www.graphile.org/>Graphile</a> are candidates, which introspect a Postgres database to output GraphQL schema from it. Those might be a bit too spartan, but we&rsquo;re toying around with them now. <a href=https://www.netlifycms.org/>Netlify CMS</a> or <a href=https://tinacms.org/>TinaCMS</a> and many other JAMStack focused offerings are extra attractive because we can ultimately serve plain old flat files. <a href=https://sapper.svelte.dev/>Sapper</a> uses Svelte and that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>The server side situation this year was really static. Nothing big changed. This next year I expect we&rsquo;ll still be running Kubernetes workloads but we may ascend to flat files and perhaps even short running processes commonly known as &lsquo;serverless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about how this last year went and even more excited about what could be coming up in 2020.</p>
