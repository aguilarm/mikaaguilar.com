<p>At any moment, I tend to have quite a few things that need my attention. I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ll need to
context switch several times during the day - from answering a question to attending a meeting or checking in
on a long-running process.</p>
<p>Jumping in and out of contexts can be pretty difficult and will really cost a lot of time.</p>
<p>In an effort to be as available as possible for the occasional interruption without spending a ton of time getting
back into whatever I&rsquo;m working on, I&rsquo;ve been using timestamped work logs. I&rsquo;ve found it helpful for quite a few
different reasons that I&rsquo;ll outline later.</p>
<h2 id=method>Method</h2>
<p>Every time I come up with a new immediate goal - usually once or twice an hour - I write it out in a notebook
after the current time. I use a small moleskin to keep each line relatively short.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1215</strong> The image element should be null. If the image is null, you cannot save.</li>
<li><strong>1251</strong> It is definitely the space in the image causing problems, loading spinner fixed.</li>
<li><strong>155</strong> The ckeditor is conflicting. Ckeditor is on the page twice.</li>
<li><strong>220</strong> Make renderer for files plugin. It needs to be backwards compatible.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, definitely a brain-dump sort of stream of consciousness thing. I use them to set
way-points throughout my day that I can go back to in order to figure out where I was and how I got there, quickly.
Most of the time, I&rsquo;ll jot one of these down before I hop on a call or something so I can get right back to
what I was doing. Just having that small note makes a big difference - coming back to an open code editor and
little else hours later is a bit daunting.</p>
<h2 id=results>Results</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing logs like this for a little over a year now, and it&rsquo;s been a huge help for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>With very little effort, I&rsquo;ve got something to refer to when I need to log hours.</li>
<li>Further, I am hyper aware of the passage of time and my estimates are <em>way</em> more accurate.</li>
<li>The act of writing something out - even just figuring out <em>what</em> to write - helps me focus and keep things in perspective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of us likely have a notepad handy. Writing down your problem or a solution you&rsquo;ve come up with is
incredibly helpful. I think augmenting your note taking with a work log is huge. Let me know if you do something
like this!</p>
